# Curriculum Crawler

## Stakeholders
* __Teachers:__ Teachers face competing priorities and time management to cover all relevant curriculum within a school year.
* __Dean of curriculum:__ Reducing overlapping topics through multiple curriculums can help optimize teachers' time, and add value to students' learning calendar.
* __Principal:__ All of the above allows Principals to strategize staffing and allow parents to follow clear learning projections.
* __Students:__ Students gain knowledge in order of learning, which keeps prequisites in check through cross curriculums, without wasting time on duplicated topics through multiple classes
* __Parents:__ Parents can feel confident knowing that the children have organized education levels of learning.
